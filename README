Git Release Notes (Git-1.7.3.1-preview20101002)
Last update: 2 October 2010

Introduction

These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release.

General release notes covering the history of the core git commands are included in the subdirectory doc/git/html of the installation directory. Look for files starting with RelNotes.

Known issues
Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation; namely: git archimport, git cvsexportcommit, git cvsimport, git cvsserver, git instaweb, git shell.
The Logitec QuickCam software can cause spurious crashes. See "Why does make often crash creating a sh.exe.stackdump file when I try to compile my source code?" on the MinGW Wiki (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Environment_issues)
The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.
curl uses $HOME/_netrc instead of $HOME/.netrc.
If you want to specify a different location for --upload-pack, you have to start the absolute path with two slashes. Otherwise MSys will mangle the path.
git and bash have serious problems with non-ASCII file names (Issue 80, 159).
If configured to use plink, you will have to connect with putty first and accept the host key.
As merge tools are executed using the MSys bash, options starting with "/" need to be handled specially: MSys would interpret that as a POSIX path, so you need to double the slash (Issue 226).  Example: instead of "/base", say "//base".  Also, extra care has to be paid to pass Windows programs Windows paths, as they have no clue about MSys style POSIX paths -- You can use something like $(cmd //c echo "$POSIXPATH").

Changes since Git-1.6.5.1-preview20091022

New Features
Comes with official Git 1.7.0.2.
Comes with Git-Cheetah (on 32-bit Windows only, for now).
Comes with connect.exe, a SOCKS proxy.
Tons of improvements in the installer, thanks to Sebastian Schuberth.
On Vista, if possible, symlinks are used for the built-ins.
Features Hany's dos2unix tool, thanks to Sebastian Schuberth.
Updated Tcl/Tk to version 8.5.8 (thanks Pat Thoyts!).
By default, only .git/ is hidden, to work around a bug in Eclipse (thanks to Erik Faye-Lund).

git gui was fixed for all kinds of worktree-related failures (thanks Pat Thoyts).
git gui now fully supports themed widgets (thanks Pat Thoyts and Heiko Voigt).
Git no longer complains about an unset RUNTIME_PREFIX (thanks Johannes Sixt).
git gui can Explore Working Copy on Windows again (thanks Markus Heidelberg).
git gui can create shortcuts again (fixes issue 425, thanks Heiko Voigt).
When "git checkout" cannot overwrite files because they are in use, it will offer to try again, giving the user a chance to release the file (thanks Heiko Voigt).
Ctrl+W will close gitk (thanks Jens Lehmann).
git gui no longer binds Ctrl+C, which caused problems when trying to use said shortcut for the clipboard operation "Copy" (fixes issue 423, thanks Pat Thoyts).
gitk does not give up when the command line length limit is reached (issue 387).
The exit code is fixed when Git.cmd is called from cmd.exe (thanks Alexey Borzenkov).
When launched via the (non-Cheetah) shell extension, the window icon is now correct (thanks Sebastian Schuberth).

Changes since Git-1.6.4-preview20090729

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.5.1.
Thanks to Johan 't Hart, files and directories starting with a single dot (such as '.git') will now be marked hidden (you can disable this setting with core.hideDotFiles=false in your config) (Issue 288).
Thanks to Thorvald Natvig, Git on Windows can simulate symbolic links by using reparse points when available.  For technical reasons, this only works for symbolic links pointing to files, not directories.
A lot of work has been put into making it possible to compile Git's source code (the part written in C, of course, not the scripts) with Microsoft Visual Studio.  This work is ongoing.
Thanks to Sebastian Schuberth, we only offer the (Tortoise)Plink option in the installer if the presence of Plink was detected and at least one Putty session was found..
Thanks to Sebastian Schuberth, the installer has a nicer icon now.
Some more work by Sebastian Schuberth was done on better integration of Plink (Issues 305 & 319).

Changes since Git-1.6.3-preview20090507

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.3.2.
Uses TortoisePlink instead of Plink if available.

Bugfixes
Plink errors out rather than hanging when the user needs to accept a host key first (Issue 96).
The user home directory is inferred from $HOMEDRIVE\$HOMEPATH instead of $HOME (Issue 108).
The environment setting $CYGWIN=tty is ignored (Issues 138, 248 and 251).
The "ls" command shows non-ASCII filenames correctly now (Issue 188).
Adds more syntax files for vi (Issue 250).
$HOME/.bashrc is included last from /etc/profile, allowing .bashrc to override all settings in /etc/profile (Issue 255).
Completion is case-insensitive again (Issue 256).
The "start" command can handle arguments with spaces now (Issue 258).
For some Git commands (such as "git commit"), vi no longer "restores" the cursor position.

Changes since Git-1.6.2.2-preview20090408

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.3.
Thanks to Marius Storm-Olsen, Git has a substantially faster readdir() implementation now.
Marius Storm-Olsen also contributed a patch to include nedmalloc, again speeding up Git noticably.
Compiled with GCC 4.4.0

Bugfixes
Portable Git contains a README.portable.
Portable Git now actually includes the builtins.
Portable Git includes git-cmd.bat and git-bash.bat.
Portable Git is now shipped as a .7z; it still is a self-extracting archive if you rename it to .exe.
Git includes the Perl Encode module now.
Git now includes the filter-branch tool.
There is a workaround for a Windows 7 regression triggering a crash in the progress reporting (e.g. during a clone). This fixes issues 236 and 247.
gitk tries not to crash when it is closed while reading references (Issue 125, thanks Pat Thoyts).
In some setups, hard-linking is not as reliable as it should be, so we have a workaround which avoids hard links in some situations (Issues 222 and 229).
git-svn sets core.autocrlf to false now, hopefully shutting up most of the git-svn reports.

Changes since Git-1.6.2.1-preview20090322

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.2.2.
Upgraded Tcl/Tk to 8.5.5.
TortoiseMerge is supported by mergetool now.
Uses pthreads (faster garbage collection on multi-core machines).
The test suite passes!

Bugfixes
Renaming was made more robust (due to Explorer or some virus scanners, files could not be renamed at the first try, so we have to try multiple times).
Johannes Sixt made lots of changes to the test-suite to identify properly which tests should pass, and which ones cannot pass due to limitations of the platform.
Support PAGERs with spaces in their filename.
Quite a few changes were undone which we needed in the olden days of msysGit.
Fall back to / when HOME cannot be set to the real home directory due to locale issues (works around Issue 108 for the moment).

Changes since Git-1.6.2-preview20090308

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.2.1.
A portable application is shipped in addition to the installer (Issue 195).

Temporary files are created respecting core.autocrlf (Issue 177).
The Git Bash prompt is colorful again (Issue 199).
Fixed crash when hardlinking during a clone failed (Issue 204).
An infinite loop was fixed in git-gui (Issue 205).
The ssh protocol is always used with plink.exe (Issue 209).
More vim files are shipped now, so that syntax highlighting works.

Changes since Git-1.6.1-preview20081225

New Features

Comes with upgraded vim 7.2.
Compiled with GCC 4.3.3.

Changes since Git-1.5.6.1-preview20080701

Removed Features
git svn is excluded from the end-user installer (see Known Issues).

New Features
Comes with official git 1.6.0.2.

Bugfixes
No Windows-specific bugfixes.

Changes since Git-1.5.6-preview20080622

New Features
Comes with official git 1.5.6.1.

Bugfixes
Includes fixed msys-1.0.dll that supports Vista and Windows Server 2008 (Issue 122).
cmd wrappers do no longer switch off echo.

Changes since Git-1.5.5-preview20080413

New Features
Comes with official git 1.5.6.
Installer supports configuring a user provided plink (PuTTY).

Bugfixes
Comes with tweaked msys-1.0.dll to solve some command line mangling issues.
cmd wrapper does no longer close the command window.
Programs in the system PATH, for example editors, can be launched from Git without specifying their full path.
"git stash apply stash@{1}" works.
Comes with basic ANSI control code emulation for the Windows console to avoid wrapping of pull/merge's diffstats.
Git correctly passes port numbers to PuTTY's plink 

Changes since Git-1.5.4-preview20080202

New Features
Comes with official git 1.5.5.
core.autocrlf is enabled (true) by default. This means git converts to Windows line endings (CRLF) during checkout and converts to Unix line endings (LF) during commit. This is the right choice for cross-platform projects. If the conversion is not reversible, git warns the user. The installer warns about the new default before the installation starts.
The user does no longer have to "accept" the GPL but only needs to press "continue".
Installer deletes shell scripts that have been replaced by builtins. Upgrading should be safer.
Supports "git svn". Note that the performance might be below your expectation.

Bugfixes
Newer ssh fixes connection failures (issue 74).
Comes with MSys-1.0.11-20071204.  This should solve some "fork: resource unavailable" issues.
All DLLs are rebased to avoid problems with "fork" on Vista.

Changes since Git-1.5.3.6-preview20071126

New Features
Comes with official git 1.5.4.
Some commands that are not yet suppoted on Windows are no longer included (see Known Issues above).
Release notes are displayed in separate window.
Includes qsort replacement to improve performance on Windows 2000.

Bugfixes
Fixes invalid error message that setup.ini cannot be deleted on uninstall.
Setup tries harder to finish the installation and reports more detailed errors.
Vim's syntax highlighting is suitable for dark background.

Changes since Git-1.5.3.5-preview20071114

New Features
Git is included in version 1.5.3.6.
Setup displays release notes.

Bugfixes
pull/fetch/push in git-gui works. Note, there is no way for ssh to ask for a passphrase or for confirmation if you connect to an unknown host. So, you must have ssh set up to work without passphrase. Either you have a key without passphrase, or you started ssh-agent. You may also consider using PuTTY by pointing GIT_SSH to plink.exe and handle your ssh keys with Pageant. In this case you should include your login name in urls. You must also connect to an unknown host once from the command line and confirm the host key, before you can use it from git-gui.

Changes since Git-1.5.3-preview20071027

New Features
Git is included in version 1.5.3.5.
Setup can be installed as normal user.
When installing as Administrator, all icons except the Quick Launch icon will be created for all users.
"git help user-manual" displays the user manual.

Bugfixes
Git Bash works on Windows XP 64.

Changes since Git-1.5.3-preview20071019

Bugfixes
The templates for a new repository are found.
The global configuration /etc/gitconfig is found.
Git Gui localization works. It falls back to English if a translation has errors.
